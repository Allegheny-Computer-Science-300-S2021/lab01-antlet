## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODo` with your response.

### First Tool

 1.What kind of research is this method or tool used for?-
 The method of computer aided drug design is used for the research of complex biological processes to improve drug discovery.

 2.How does this method or tool work? What does it do?-
This method uses algorithms for the study of chemical interaction relationships, computer programs for designing compounds with unusual physico-chemical characteristic, etc.

 3.Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?-
 This method was necessary to develop because it completes large and complex tasks far quicker than humans. Because of this, the speed at which knowledge and progress advances is much greater than the past.

 4.What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?-
 By relying only on this method rather than significant brain-power as well, important aspects could be overlooked.


### Second Tool

 1.What kind of research is this method or tool used for?-
 The BLAST (Basic local alignment search tool) is used for finding local similarity between sequences.

 2.How does this method or tool work? What does it do?-
 This tool compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches.

 3.Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?-
 This tool was necessary to develop for the ease of finding sequence similarities. In the same way that Google is a fast way to find results, this tool acts in the same way.

 4.What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?-
 The misuse of this tool could cause users to interperate the results in a way that in not beneficial. The important thing to remember about the tool is that it only produces the statistical significance based on databases.
